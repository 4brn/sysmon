## 1. Introduction

Infrastructure is the backbone of today's world. Millions of devices service our daily technical and informational needs. Therefore there is a need to monitor and ensure these devices function correctly. Even though I won't be able to create a solution for enterprise usage, I can provide a solution for enthusiasts.

### 1.1 Project overview

Project consists of two parts: 
1. **Host**

   > Software installed on a device, allowing a client to connect to said device in order to receive the data (cpu, memory, etc.).

2. **Client**

    > Web dashboard that allows user to remotely connect to devices with the host program running and view information about them in real time. 

### 1.2 Topics covered:

- Networking & Cloud

- Intelligent Technologies

- Software Engineering

## 2. Topics

### 2.1 Networking & Cloud

- Remote connectivity
- WebSockets
- Scalability

The project uses a client server architecture. Devices act as a server, collecting relevant system information and wait for a connection from a client, while the client visualizes received information. Host devices are independent, because they hold all the logic, allowing for a seamless expansion and scalability of monitored devices.

Project reflects key concepts in cloud infrastructure and networking.

### 2.2 Intelligent Technologies

- Embedded Software Design
- Hardware-Software Interfacing
- Resource Efficient Programming

The agent acts as a continuous background process agent without changing the primary function of the device it is installed on. Moreover the system metric data extraction needs to be done without using a lot of computational resources, resembling the resource efficient programming used in Embedded Systems. 

### 2.3 Software Engineering

- Client-Server architecture
- Web development

The Projects project uses a client-server architecture, used in almost every software product. Moreover it uses development standards like version management (git) and APIs.

## 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, the project outlines a major learning opportunity, covering key topics in the area of ICT and overall being an interesting and reasonably complex second project.
