## Introduction

The aim of the project is to create a real-time system monitoring dashboard for homelab environments. The system will collect performance metrics from multiple machines and display them in a centralized web interface, enabling remote monitoring and historical data analysis.

## Objective

The main objective is to create a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly monitoring system in the span of 3 weeks.

The system will:

- **Monitor in real-time**: Display live CPU, memory, and disk metrics with sub-second updates
- **Support multiple machines**: Track metrics from 2-3+ machines simultaneously
- **Store historical data**: Enable analysis of past performance trends
- **Enable remote access**: Monitor homelab from anywhere via VPN
- **Minimize resource usage**: Lightweight agents with minimal system impact

## Main Question

How to efficiently monitor multiple machines in real-time with minimal overhead?

## MoSCoW Method

### Must Have
- Agent collecting system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Local SQLite storage for historical data
- WebSocket server for real-time streaming
- Central registry for agent discovery
- Web dashboard displaying live metrics
- Basic charts visualization
- Agent auto-registration

### Should Have
- Connection status indicators
- Error handling and reconnection logic
- Historical data queries (last 24 hours)
- Multiple chart types
- Tailscale VPN setup

### Could Have
- Alert notifications
- Custom metric collection intervals
- Data export functionality
- Agent management UI

### Won't Have (for v1.0)
- Advanced authentication system
- Complex data aggregations
- Mobile app
- Multi-user support
- Cloud deployment

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- Real-time monitoring
- Minimal dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Low resource footprint
- Simple deployment

### Weaknesses
- Limited to local network (without VPN)
- Single-user design
- Basic visualization

### Opportunities
- Add more metric types (network, temperature)
- Implement alerting system
- Create mobile dashboard
- Add data aggregation features

### Threats
- Network connectivity issues
- WebSocket connection instability
- SQLite file corruption
- Agent crashes

## Stakeholders

**Primary User**: Self (homelab administrator)

**Power/Interest Matrix:**
- High Power, High Interest: Self (developer and end user)
- Low Power, Low Interest: N/A (personal project)
